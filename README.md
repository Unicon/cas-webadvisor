#CAS Authentication for Web Advisor

##Intro
This project is based on [Single Sign On to WebAdvisor Using CAS, ClearPass, and a Custom Java Filter](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASC/Single+Sign+On+to+WebAdvisor+Using+CAS%2C+ClearPass%2C+and+a+Custom+Java+Filter), developed by Adam Rybicki. The code hosted in this repository only provides the project basic template that will execute the maven overlay, adding the extra WebAdvisor filter and web.xml entries onto the target WebAdvisor WAR file. 

##Configuration
* Place the WebAdvisor WAR file inside the lib directory of the project. The build process assumes this file is so named `WebAdvisor.war`
```xml
```
